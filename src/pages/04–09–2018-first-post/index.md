title: "About this Blog"

In this first blog I want to give you a brief introduction of who I am and what this blog is mainly
about. I intended this blog to be a sports analytics blog at first, but then I thought it
can also serve as a blog just about my life. 

As a kid growing up, I always enojoyed playing and watching basketball, maybe because I was tall,
 maybe because I was raised in the US, either way, ever since then, playing and watching basketball has always been 
 an essential and inseparable part of my life. I would play afer school, on weekend, I even played two years
 of senior varsity in highschool. Playing basketball was always a safe haven for me, it kept me sanctured away from all the noise from 
 this forever busy world, there were times when I wished life was as simple and as pure as playing basketball.
 
Fast forward to University, I developed a love for three S's: Statistics, Software and Shawarmas.Inevitably I was hit 
with the notorious freshman's ~~15 and got too fat to play basketball at a highly competitive level anymore~~
rough transition from highschool and the busy school schedule and got too busy to play basketball regularly. 
But my love for basketball hasn't decrease at all, very much like my shawarma obsession. I still watch and follow 
basketball games religiously, discuss games and players highlights with my friends every now and then. 

Two of the first three internships I got were software development roles, I loved the work but it always felt like
 it was missing something, the breakdown of the job was more or less trying to understand how the services were 
 pipelined and how each part worked. The implementation of new features were fairly straight forward after that. 
 I feel like there was something missing but I can't describe what it was. 
  
During my second Co-op one of my friends sent me an article about how Facebook utilizes user data and optimizes 
advertising strategy using the data. I was shocked at how much impact  data could do, and that
was when I was introduced to the idea of data science. It was the prefect combination of stats , analytics and 
software. The more research I did on the topic the more I solidified the idea that this is what I wanted to do 
as a career.Data science is such a wide field and is always expanding. From AI, to machine learning to analytics
to NLP to neural networks. I was excited to start but overwhelmed by all the information and don't know where 
to start! 

After a couple of months of researching and reading on materials,it suddenly hit me that maybe I could combine 
my two passions, basketball and ~~shawarma~~  statistics! There are plenty of statistical analytics to be done in 
basketball, I loved staring at players/teams stats and talking about it already, why not take the whole thing to 
the internet and integrate data science into it? So that's how I came up with the idea of this blog, I built it using
a really powerful static site generating framework called Gatsby.js that uses React to render components as well
as Facebook's graphic query language Graphql to pull data from markdown files to be generated into html files
and optimize performance. I deployed this site using netlify and one of the best things about netlify is that 
it allows you to integrate your github account along with the site so every time you make a commit to github netlify 
will automatically trigger a deployment achieving continuous integration. Another couple more tweeks here and there 
and voil√†! You have this blog!

The purpose of this blog is really just a platform for me to share my personal stance and analytics about basketball
and I do not tend to start any debate, which is why i purposely left out a comment section. I do hope through this 
 blog I can make people learn maybe just a little bit of something new or to be able to increase their interest 
 in either basketball or data science, but whatever reason you came for, I really do hope you enjoy the blog!!

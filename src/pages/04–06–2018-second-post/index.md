There was a time when I would hear the name Melo and thought of the 10X NBA all star Melo; the scoring champ
Melo; the 2010 - 2013 New York Melo; the 4X Olypmic gold medalist Melo,the all time team US scorer ; the team
US record holder for 3 points made and single points scored in a game Melo. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately , that time has passed. <br/><br/>
Now when I hear the name Melo, I think of the OKC Melo who's struggling to get pass the first round of playoff
against the Jazz. Looking at the past season's performance, it's clear that he is no longer the dangerous Melo 
that drove fear into the opponents. For the first time in his career he was not invited to the team US tryouts,
he wasn't selected as an all star, etc. But how bad is Melo this year? How big of a change did he experience and 
is he the reason why the Thunder are struggling even though with such a flashy roster? <br/><br/>
Now let's jump right in the data analytics, first I imported the 2017-2018 season player data for Melo from 
[baskerball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a public site where there's an abundance of player
and team data available for you and can be exported to csv files which makes it so much easier to collect and analyze.
